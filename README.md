# Multimodal-Sarcasm-Detection
Developed a multimodal sarcasm detection model, which can detect sarcasm from Audio as well as Text inputs. 

The dataset that we used for this project comprised of TV clips of famous sitcoms like FRIENDS, TBBT etc.

Sarcasm is often used by people to taunt or pester others. It is frequently expressed through inflection in speech or by using lexical, pragmatic, hyperbolic, and other features present in the text. Most of the work done by the researchers has been focused more on detecting sarcasm from the latter part, that is text data rather than the former that is audio. In this paper, we show that it is important to use both textual as well as audio features while detecting sarcasm. To carry out this task we propose a hybrid model, which takes a combined vector of extracted audio features as well as extracted text features from their respective models as an input. Our results indicate that the shortcomings of text were compensated by audio and vice-versa. The hybrid model outperforms both models where text and audio features were used individually.   

The types of features used for detecting sarcasm in text and audio are summarized in the below figure.

The entire coding was done using python 3 and by using the google colab environment.

This project was completed as a part of my final year project in order to obtain my undergraduate degree.
